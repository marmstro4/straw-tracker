Each of the gas cells must be supplied with a ~kV current down their length.

This means some kind of HV supply. This supply must be _**relatively**_ stable so we can  read out the signal without huge fluctuations within the time window.

Once charge is collected is must be processed with some kind of [[PreAmp|amplification/shaping]] stage.

After processing the the waveform can be digitized. One option for this is a [CAEN digitizer](https://www.caen.it/sections/digitizer-families/).
