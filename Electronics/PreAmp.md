The straw tracker PreAmp is a front end electronics device that recieves the charge deposited by electronics ionised in the drift cell and amplifies and shapes it.

The amplification is fairly self-explanitory while conventional shaping is a [more-complicated process](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41365-020-00799-2).

1. Split the signal in two
2. Delay and invert one copy
4. Combine the two signals so there's a "down and then up" sort of shape
5. Optimize the amplification and delay so there's a clear crossing point
