#simulations

As explored in [[Gas system]] there are many possble gas mixtures. 

The two focused on here are He-co2 and Ar-co2.

When I increase the concentration of co2 in He mixture there's a worsening of resolution up to ~5% then a slight decline.

These differences are however on the order of less than a millimeter, therefore I am suspicious of drawing any conclusion given how much these resolutions seem to vary on their own. Otherwise I'd conclude that between 1-10% co2 is fine.
