Shifting the electrode voltage doesn't have much of an effect on the vertex resolution with a dissapoiting R^2=0.06

At extremes voltage would surely be a problem but ultimately any electronics bought for the array would have a tuneable supply. The important conclusion is that a ~kV supply will be required.
