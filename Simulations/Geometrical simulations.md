Having learned the design parameters of the straws themselves aren't so sensitive outside of size and positioning a series of geometrical simulations were performed.

Here is a straw tube array geometry where the straws are transverse to the target for maximum z sensitivity.

In the transverse box design there are four detector modules. These are simply rectangular stacks of detectors.

Writing the reconstruction algorithm one obtains a resolution of ~1.5mm. Here plotted is the reconstructed vertex in [mm] centered at 0. There are some weird periodic features however so not this needs to be improved.
