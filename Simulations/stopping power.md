The energy lost by a 100 MeV proton in 1cm of common [[Gas system|drift chamber gas mixtures]] are below. These were calculated with [LISE++](https://lise.frib.msu.edu/lise.html)



| Gas mixture      | energy loss [keV] |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Argon-C02 P10    | 8.3               |
| Helium Methane   | 5.8               |
| Helium Isobutane | 2.3               |
