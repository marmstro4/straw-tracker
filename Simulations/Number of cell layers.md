I did an investigation into the change in vertex resolution as a function of the number of rows.

As one goes from 5 layers to 13, one improves the resolution by a millimeter. The number of rows is therefore pretty significant. 

We can only afford [[Electronics|electronics ]]for ~300 straws unfortunately however and this translates to 5 layers.

Having only 5 layers does however make fitting [[Mechanics|comfortably in the limited space within the GRETA sphere]] easier.
