Goals:
To contribute to the design of the straw tracker array by getting a handle on requirements and options.

To this end [[Garfield++]] simulations were produced by one of Heather's undergraduates to simulate the drift cells and [[Michael's Garfield simulations]]|determine the optimal drift cell design parameters.
]]
From this it was concluded that a series of[[Geometrical simulations| purely geometrical simulations]] were required to decide where to put the newly designed drift cells
