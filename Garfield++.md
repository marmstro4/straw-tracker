[Garfield++](https://gitlab.cern.ch/garfield/garfieldpp) can help us to simulate the drift chambers themselves.

A [number of simulations](griffin) were produced by and are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nf2L8oNiQU0f7fJTB5xLGWMObTtt_v6N?usp=drive_link) for download.

The user guide for Garfield++ is below ![[UserGuide.pdf]]

In [[Michael's Garfield simulations|Michael"s simulations]] different gas mixtures are investigated.

Be warned that making gases in Garfield takes ~1-2h. Interestingly chaning the field parameters doesn't actually change this much.
