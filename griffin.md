The simplest example is "DriftTube Example Notebook"  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nf2L8oNiQU0f7fJTB5xLGWMObTtt_v6N?usp=drive_link)

To get this to work one requires [[ar_93_co2_7.gas]] which can either be generated or found in an example file.

This is an electrode at 2730 V  enclosed by a 71mm radius tube containing argon and CO2.

The HEED is the particle track, in this case a muon at 170 GeV

The muons fly straight through the medium.

The signal collected in the electrode is overtime ![[Pasted image 20241111162717.png]]

In the sixth iteration they achieve the following image: ![[Pasted image 20241111164302.png]]
This seems to yield a position resolution of [mm]

z=0.1\pm3.3
