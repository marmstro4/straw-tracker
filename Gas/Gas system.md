#gas

The drift chamber cells must be filled with a easily ionized gas for sufficient charge to be collected.

Some examples of commercially available gas mixtures used for this purpose include:

 1. **Argon**: Argon is a widely used gas due to its high ionization potential and cost-effectiveness. It creates a good amount of ionization with low absorption of photons, making it a staple choice for many drift chambers.
    
2. **Methane (CH₄)**: Methane is often mixed with argon (e.g., an Argon-Methane mix, called "Ar-CH₄" or "P-10 gas," which is 90% argon and 10% methane). Methane acts as a quenching gas, reducing the probability of secondary ionization by absorbing UV photons that would otherwise cause additional ionization, which can lead to sparking or unstable operation.
    
3. **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: CO₂ is sometimes used as a quenching gas in mixtures with argon. It’s particularly useful for high-energy particle detection, as it helps improve electron drift properties and adds stability by reducing the chance of discharges.
    
4. **Isobutane (C₄H₁₀)**: Isobutane is another common quenching gas, particularly in chambers requiring high detection efficiency and resolution. It provides good quenching properties and helps stabilize the chamber by absorbing UV photons.
    
5. **Helium**: Helium-based mixtures (e.g., Helium-Isobutane) are used when low mass density is required, such as in particle physics experiments where minimal interference with particle paths is desired. It offers a high drift velocity for electrons and is often used in experiments where precision tracking is critical.
    
6. **Xenon**: While less common due to its higher cost, xenon provides a high ionization yield and is sometimes used in specialized applications requiring high stopping power for particles.

Some popular options include:
1. **P-10 Gas (90% Argon, 10% Methane)**: One of the most widely used gases, P-10 is readily available and popular for its stability and ease of use in drift chambers.
    
2. **Argon-CO₂ Mixtures**: Mixtures with different Argon-CO₂ ratios, such as 80:20 or 70:30, are available for detectors where Argon-CO₂ offers ideal quenching and drift properties.
   
   [Lindedirect.com](https://www.lindedirect.com/store/product-search/2?searchCriteria=Argon%20Methane) offers Ar-Methane in 1% increments up to 10% then 5% increments above  
    
3. **Helium-Based Mixtures**: Helium-isobutane mixtures and helium-based gases with CO₂ or other quenchers can be sourced for applications needing low-density gases to minimize interference with particle trajectories.
   
   [Lindedirect.com](https://www.lindedirect.com/store/product-search/2?searchCriteria=Argon%20Methane) offers Helium-CO2  in 1% increments up to 10% then 5% increments above. Helium-methane is also available to a lesser extent.

The [[stopping power]] of 100 MeV protons in all these gases is a few keV so don't have to worry so much about material budget of gas.



**For the sake of safety should try to stick away from flammable gases**
